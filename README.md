## How To Use

Flash the image to your Car Thing using [nocturne-image](https://github.com/brandonsaldan/nocturne-image/).

**Note: The Debian image used to run this software on the Spotify Car Thing hardware currently does not support GPU acceleration. Some animations within the program may appear as laggy on-device, but we're working on a fix!**

## Credits

This software was made possible only through the following individuals and open source programs:

- [Benjamin McGill](https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjamin-mcgill/), for giving me a Car Thing to develop with
- [shadow](https://github.com/68p), for testing, troubleshooting, and crazy good repo maintainence
- [bishopdynamics](https://github.com/bishopdynamics), for creating the original [superbird-tool](https://github.com/bishopdynamics/superbird-tool), and [superbird-debian-kiosk](https://github.com/bishopdynamics/superbird-debian-kiosk)
- [Car Thing Hax Community's fork of superbird-tool](https://github.com/Car-Thing-Hax-Community/superbird-tool), for their contributions on the original superbird-tool
